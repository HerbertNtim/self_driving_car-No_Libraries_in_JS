This project is a **learning-based implementation** of a simple self-driving car simulation built entirely with **vanilla JavaScript (no external libraries)**.  

The goal of the repo is not production-grade autonomy, but rather to **understand the fundamentals** of how a self-driving car might "see," "think," and "act" using code.

## ðŸ“– About the Project

- Written in **plain JavaScript**, HTML, and CSS.  
- Uses the **HTML5 Canvas** to simulate a car driving in an environment.  
- Implements concepts like:  
  - Basic car physics (acceleration, friction, steering)  
  - Road and lane rendering  
  - Collision detection  
  - Simple "sensors" for the car to detect surroundings  
  - A decision-making mechanism to control the car  

This project is purely for **educational purposes** â€” it helped me understand both **JavaScript fundamentals** and some **AI/autonomy concepts** in a fun way.
